# What is full stack web development ?

First, let's define _front end or client-side_ and _back end or server-side_ and _three Tier Architecture_.

_Front end_ is about presenting the data to the users (technologies as HTML, CSS and Javascript are used).

_Back end_ is concerned with the business logic (technologies as Php, Java, Ruby... are used).

_Three Tier Architecture_ a common client-server software architecture pattern is divided in three layers : _presentation layer or front end_, concerned with the UI related issues, _business logic layer or back end_, concerned with data valisation and data processing and _data access layer_ wich deals with data persistence and storage of data.

These layers ofently use different languages for their implementation, so they need 3 type of specialist.

_Full Stack Web development_ use a single language for implementation over the entire stack. For exemple, we could be having the front implemented in a Javascript Framework like AngularJS, the server-side implemented using NodeJS wich is another framework of Javascript, and the data access layer implemented in JSON.
